This project provides a web-based attendance management system for faculty to track student attendance in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:
Secure faculty login using a separate signup page.
Mark student attendance as present, absent, or on leave.
Submit attendance for a selected class.
Files:
index.html: The main page for marking attendance.
signup.html: The faculty login page.
styles.css: Stylesheet for the user interface of the main page.
style1.css: Stylesheet for user interface of signup page.
script.js: JavaScript code for functionality of main page.
script1.js: Javascript code for functionality of signup page.

Setup:
Download and extract the project files.
Open signup.html in a web browser to access the application.
Note: This is a basic setup and doesn't include functionalities like user authentication or data storage on a server.

How to Use:
Faculty members need to access the signup page first (signup.html) to enter their credentials and log in.
Upon successful login, they will be redirected to the main attendance marking page (index.html).
For each student listed, choose their attendance status (present, absent, leave).
Once all student attendance is marked, click the "Submit Attendance" button.
Professional Design:
Use a minimalist and clean design with a professional color scheme.
Employ clear and concise labels for buttons and input fields.
Apply consistent typography and spacing throughout the interface.

Further Enhancement:
Implement functionalities like displaying previous attendance records.
Integrate with a database to store and retrieve attendance data persistently.
Add features for exporting attendance data to different formats (CSV, PDF).
(To gamify)
Add a way to gamify it by adding leaderboards and a point system.
